\section{Other experiments}
Apart from the milestones and planning in \secref{sec:plan} there are some other activities it may be good to experiment with.

\subsection{S3 access to NCSA}
Storage remains the cost driver for cloud. We have an S3 interface exposing data a t NCSA,
we could attempt some processing on the cloud accessing image data at NCSA.

\subsection{Qserv 75\% scaling}
Qserv scale tests should go to 75\% of DR1.  This requires a lot of nodes for a short time,
we do not need to necessarily keep all those nodes once the test is done. This is an
ideal cloud scenario if we have Qserv working in an understood manner on the cloud. \citeds{DMTN-125} would suggest we can at least do this in principle.
