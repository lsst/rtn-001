The main departments involved in DP0 are Data Production and System Performance. With in those departments various people will be involved from the underlying teams but in small numbers. It makes most sense to approach DP0 with a task force approach. This might best be seen as two teams:

\item Data production - with a focus on middleware and execution (\secref{sec:dp});
\item System Performance - with a focus on quality assurance and community support (\secref{sec:sp}).

with team leads for each team.

There is preops effort (fractional FTE) available in Execution and Pipelines as well as Middleware teams.
